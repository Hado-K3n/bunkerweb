# Install Bunkerweb on your managed K8S cluster

## Bunkerweb installation 

Bunkerweb can easily be installed from the yaml file you would find on [Bunkerity's Github](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/tree/master/misc/integrations) under the same prefix __"K8S.*.yaml"__.


Once your managed kubernetes cluster is in place, you need to personnalize your downloaded yaml file to fit your specifications.
